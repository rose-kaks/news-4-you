Through a qualitative multiple-case study analysis of leading developers operating under Uzbekistan\u2019s distinctive \u201cUzbek Model\u201d of reverse auctions and centralized procurement, the research identifies three core strategic domains: proactive institutional creation, pragmatic mitigation of institutional voids, and the management of paradoxical relationships with both the state and competitors. The findings introduce and develop the concept of orchestration strategy a firm-level dynamic capability to simultaneously compete within a state-defined arena while collaborating to build its institutional and operational foundations. The study contributes to non-market strategy and institutional theory by bridging macro-transition pathways with micro-level strategic action, and offers practical insights for firms and policymakers navigating similar state-orchestrated green energy transitions.",

            "desc": "LAHORE: (Wednesday, February 04, 2026): Punjab University Vice Chancellor Prof Dr Muhammad Ali has said that Pakistan\u2019s stability is a must to resolve the Kashmir Issue which is not possible without development in the education sector. He expressed these views while addressing a seminar on \u201cEchoes of the Battle for Truth, the Contemporary Global World and the Kashmir Issue\u201d organized by the Punjab University Faculty of Arts and Humanities. On this occasion, Pro-Vice Chancellor Prof Dr Khalid Mahmood, senior journalist Salman Ghani, Dean Faculty of Arts and Humanities Prof Dr Mehboob Hussain, Chairman Department of Kashmir Studies Dr Khawaja Zahid Aziz, faculty members and a large number of students were present. In his address, Prof Dr Muhammad Ali said that every year Pakistan renews its pledge that the hearts of Pakistanis beat with Kashmir and that the entire nation stands with the Kashmiris until they achieve their right to self-determination. He said that the \u2018Battle for Truth\u2019 has given Pakistan remarkable diplomatic successes and international recognition. He added that this is the best opportunity to become the voice of the Kashmiris, but unity in thought and ideas is essential. He said that just as Pakistan defeated India in war through technology; it must also strengthen itself in science and technology for the cause of Kashmir. He emphasized that Pakistan\u2019s stance on Kashmir is rightful, while India is making illegitimate demands. He further stated that Kashmiris and Palestinians are among the most oppressed people in the world. Prof Dr Khalid Mahmood stressed that nations are heard at the global level only when they strengthen themselves in education and technology. He said that in the present era, academic and technological progress forms the basis of national dignity and an effective global role. He said that PU is fully expressing solidarity with its Kashmiri brothers and sisters, and that the university has always played a responsible role at national and international levels by consistently supporting the Kashmiri people\u2019s right to self-determination. Senior journalist Salman Ghani said that from 1990 to the present day, all political leaders of Pakistan have played an active role in highlighting the importance of the Kashmir issue. He said that Kashmiris know that Pakistan\u2019s strength is essential to free them from Indian oppression. He remarked that the martyrdom of Burhan Muzaffar Wani instilled fear among Indians, who began seeing Burhan Wani in every Kashmiri youth. He described the Pahalgam incident as an Indian conspiracy, stating that India became trapped in its own plot. He said that when the nation stood united with the Pakistan Army; a power six times stronger was pushed back, resulting in a clear victory. He added that the Pakistan Air Force was declared the \u201cQueen of the Skies,\u201d which was made possible through unity and harmony. He emphasized that the entire nation must remain united to resolve the Kashmir issue and to confront enemies like India and Israel. He said that PU is not only an educational institution but also an excellent platform for highlighting national issues. Prof Dr Mehboob Hussain said that the Kashmir issue is a national matter on which not only all political parties of Pakistan but the entire nation is united and in agreement, with no differences whatsoever. He said that all political parties are aligned on the point that joint and organized efforts must be made for the Kashmiri people\u2019s right to self-determination. He stated that national unity on the Kashmir issue is Pakistan\u2019s greatest strength. He added that Pakistan has now emerged on the global stage with a new and positive image, and the world is listening to Pakistan\u2019s voice. He reaffirmed Pakistan\u2019s commitment to continue playing an effective and responsible role at international forums for a just resolution of the Kashmir issue. Dr Khawaja Zahid Aziz highlighted the historical importance of the Kashmir issue. He exposed India\u2019s reprehensible role on the Kashmir issue at the United Nations. He said that Pakistan and India have already fought four wars over Kashmir. He added that the Kashmiri people have made immense and unforgettable sacrifices for their right to self-determination. He said that the purpose of organizing the seminar was to convey that Kashmir remains a living and unresolved issue.",

            "desc": "Herbal medicines, derived from medicinal plants, are in high demand due to global population growth and the increasing prevalence of chronic diseases; however, the use of substitutes or adulterants can compromise the quality of these medicines. DNA barcoding and metabolite fingerprinting are used to identify plants and ensure the safety of drugs. The effectiveness of authentication methods depends on the availability and coverage of the reference library. However, reference DNA barcodes and metabolite fingerprint libraries for traditional Indian medicinal plants are lacking, which hinders the authentication of herbal drugs and the elucidation of the therapeutic effects of secondary metabolites. In the present study, we developed a user-friendly \u2018Comprehensive Database of Medicinal Plants, Molecular Markers, and Metabolite Fingerprinting (CDMMM)\u2019 that provides extensive details on traditional Indian medicinal plants used in drug formulations, DNA barcode sequences, metabolites, and their therapeutic targets associated with diseases. CDMMM is an expandable data resource comprising 89 experimentally obtained DNA barcode accessions from 67 plant species, 3033 annotated plant metabolites, and 1414 therapeutic targets associated with 441 diseases from 20 plant species. The ever-expanding CDMMM resource is available at https://slsdb.manipal.edu/cdmmm/. Overall, it is a powerful platform for taxonomy, systematics, species identification, and drug discovery, promoting knowledge and addressing taxonomic uncertainties.",

Through a qualitative multiple-case study analysis of leading developers operating under Uzbekistan\u2019s distinctive \u201cUzbek Model\u201d of reverse auctions and centralized procurement, the research identifies three core strategic domains: proactive institutional creation, pragmatic mitigation of institutional voids, and the management of paradoxical relationships with both the state and competitors. The findings introduce and develop the concept of orchestration strategy a firm-level dynamic capability to simultaneously compete within a state-defined arena while collaborating to build its institutional and operational foundations. The study contributes to non-market strategy and institutional theory by bridging macro-transition pathways with micro-level strategic action, and offers practical insights for firms and policymakers navigating similar state-orchestrated green energy transitions.",

            "desc": "Earth-to-Air Energy Exchangers (EAEEs) represent a promising passive solution for air preconditioning in buildings, exploiting the ground\u2019s thermal inertia. However, conventional analytical models rely on simplifying assumptions: dry air, homogeneous soil, neglected vertical section, and ignored internal condensation. Although these assumptions are necessary for an analytical formulation, they limit the models\u2019 ability to faithfully represent real system behavior, particularly in tropical and semi-arid climates. Numerical approaches (CFD, finite element methods) offer increased physical realism but remain computationally expensive and difficult to apply in parametric studies or practical sizing. In this context, this article provides a critical analysis of existing models and discusses the need for alternative analytical approaches that reconcile physical realism with engineering practicality. The Initial Basis Analysis Method (IBAM) is introduced as a continuous analytical framework capable of solving the coupled energy and mass transport equations analytically, while incorporating thin-film condensation, the vertical section, atmospheric fluctuations, and thermal and hygrometric soil variability. Rather than presenting a new experimental validation campaign, the manuscript relies on comparisons with experimental results and prior work to discuss the validity domain and practical applicability of the proposed approach. This contribution aims to clarify the assumptions, contributions, and limitations of the IBAM method, and to provide a useful analytical framework for the modeling and design of earth-to-air energy exchange systems.",

            "title": "Effect of Digital Health Interventions on College Students\u2019 Lifestyle Behaviors: Systematic Review",
            "desc": "Background: College students undergo a critical transition from adolescence to adulthood, during which lifestyle behaviors such as physical activity, sedentary behavior, diet, and sleep are key determinants of long-term health. Digital health interventions (DHIs) are increasingly recognized as a promising strategy for improving these behaviors among college students.\nObjective: This systematic review aims to evaluate the effectiveness and applicability of DHIs targeting lifestyle behaviors among college students by analyzing intervention objectives, modalities, functionalities, outcomes, and other key characteristics.\nMethods: In accordance with the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) 2020 guidelines, multiple scientific databases, including Scopus, Web of Science, PubMed, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, SPORTDiscus, ProQuest Central, APA PsycArticles, ERIC, and Academic Search Premier, were searched for studies published between January 2010 and December 2025 (initial search: August 5, 2025; updated search: December 27, 2025). The inclusion criteria were original empirical studies on DHIs targeting lifestyle behaviors (physical activity, sedentary behavior, diet, and sleep) among college students, published in English. Studies focusing on nondigital interventions, lacking sufficient methodological details, or not reporting lifestyle behavior\u2013related outcomes were excluded. Quality assessment was conducted in 2 stages: all studies were first evaluated using the Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool (2018 version), followed by Risk of Bias 2 for randomized controlled trials and Joanna Briggs Institute critical appraisal tools for nonrandomized studies. A narrative synthesis was used to present and synthesize the findings.\nResults: A total of 2998 records were retrieved, of which 46 publications met the inclusion criteria. These included 30 (65%) studies related to physical activity, 26 (57%) studies to diet, 10 (22%) studies related to sedentary behavior, and 6 (13%) studies related to sleep. This review enabled an examination of the effects of DHIs on college students\u2019 lifestyle behaviors. DHIs primarily used mobile apps, web-based platforms, and mobile communication technologies, with core functionalities such as education, guidance, monitoring, and prompting. DHIs were more effective in improving physical activity and diet; however, evidence for reducing sedentary behavior and improving sleep remained limited. Of the 46 studies, 31 (67%) reported positive effects, with larger sample sizes and intervention durations of 8-16 weeks being associated with more favorable outcomes.\nConclusions: This review focuses on college students, addressing a gap in the literature that often centers on general adult populations. Unlike previous reviews that focus on a single behavior, this study integrates multiple lifestyle behaviors and evaluates DHIs across diverse modalities and functionalities. These contributions help refine future DHIs for college students and inform health promotion strategies in higher education. Although DHIs show potential for improving lifestyle behaviors, evidence of their long-term effectiveness remains limited. Future interventions should prioritize multibehavior integration, interactivity, and population-differentiated design to enhance precision, sustainability, and equity. This study has several limitations, including issues related to sample representativeness, intervention refinement, and methodological rigor.\nTrial Registration: PROSPERO CRD420251119078; https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/PROSPERO/view/CRD420251119078",
